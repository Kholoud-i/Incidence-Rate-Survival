# Incidence Rate & Survival Analysis

PDF presentation of a reproducibility study completed in R 
I calculated age-specific incidence rates estimates for dementia and alzheimer's disease using person-years approach with Poisson distribution
Then I tested survival analysis - cox proportional hazards regression model, finally I recommended 
strengthening the data analysis through application of multiple imputation for handling missing data
